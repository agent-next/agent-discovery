# /my-review receipt — agent-discovery full-repo review, 2026-09-24/25

Scope: ALL landed code (public repo agent-next/agent-discovery). S1 target ref
pinned `e27eace`; S2 fix round on branch `fix/s2-review-round`; PR #6.
Merge stays owner-gated.

## Stages

- **S0 preflight**: tests green at start (131), ruff clean, secrets scan clean,
  ref pinned. Skiplists seeded into REVIEW.md.
- **S1 finders (4 fleets)**: Devin parent with 4 native subagent angles (A-D) +
  3 in-session finder agents (same angles) for cross-family coverage.
  ~50 findings; full report `../20260924-myreview-s1/findings-report.md`
  (A1-A17, B1-B11, C1-C15, D1-D9), dispatch prompt `../20260924-myreview-s1/prompt.txt`.
- **S3b security pass**: ran earlier on the S3b eval-injection round (PR #5,
  execution-verified HIGH + FP-filter CONFIRMED 0.97) — see git history 33d14d5, 474af2f.
- **S2 fix round**: commits ef779ed..5bd846e (area-split: harness / arrays /
  benchmark / connectors / pipeline / docs+provenance / tests / receipts).
  Every fixed finding got a regression power test (131 -> 163).
- **S3 independent gate**: grok-4.7, execution-based, writer != reviewer.
  `make check` rerun by reviewer (163 passed at its runtime). VERDICT: **FIX-FIRST**
  with 6 majors (0.82-0.97), each reproduced by the reviewer with real commands —
  `../20260924-myreview-s3/grok-s3-output.md`.
- **S2' fix round for S3 findings**: commit 77ed5d4 (all six, + power tests, 163 -> 167):
  1. tasks_total double-count (store+queue are not disjoint) — fixed, test pins 3 tasks
  2. file_report StrEnum `<` compared statuses alphabetically (accepted ACCEPTED,
     refused EXECUTED) — fixed to explicit CURATED state check, test added
  3. failed revision completion check re-entered the supervisor loop (accepting
     supervisor -> curator FileNotFoundError mid-campaign) — _dispatch restructured
     to one worker-pass loop; recovery test added
  4. completion-check stall mode unreachable after revisions — reachable now
     (EmptyRevision: gate_failures=2, revisions=1, STALLED via checks)
  5. EmptyRevision test was vacuous (deleted before the scripted writer
     resurrected the file) — deletes after; counters pin the stall MODE
  6. `_chains` refused a leading skipped copy (0,400,600 chained nothing) —
     first-gap reading explored both ways, following-gap 30% check arbitrates
- **S4 delta re-verify (round 1)**: grok-4.7 re-checked ONLY 77ed5d4 by
  execution (`../20260924-myreview-s3/grok-s4-output.md`). All six findings
  RESOLVED — each power-verified by reverting the product hunk in a scratch
  copy and watching the test fail. VERDICT: **FIX-FIRST** with 2 NEW majors
  introduced by 77ed5d4 itself:
  1. (0.93) worker follow-ups from a FAILED pass still entered triage —
     with retries a failing worker re-proposed every pass and exploded the
     task budget (probe: 30 tasks / 29 follow-ups from one seed task)
  2. (0.88) `_chains` seeded first gaps from positions[j], j > i+1, stepping
     over DETECTED copies without counting them against the single-skip
     allowance (probes 0,180,200,400,600,800 / 0,200,250,400,600,800)
  Both fixed in a151775 (triage moved after the check; chains consume
  consecutive detections; +2 power tests, 167 -> 169).
- **S4 delta round 2**: grok-4.7 re-checked ONLY a151775 by execution
  (`../20260924-myreview-s3/grok-s4b-output.md`). Both findings RESOLVED
  (revert-power proven both ways; grok's two original probes clean; exhaustive
  4004-input 50-nt-grid chain check: 0 non-consecutive chains). `make check`
  169 passed at the reviewer. VERDICT: **SHIP**. "a151775 里的新问题: 没有。"

## Final votes (S6)

| Vote | Model | Method | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Independent reviewer | grok-4.7 (reviewer lane, lanes.tsv) | execution: make check + per-finding probes + revert-based power proofs | S3: FIX-FIRST -> S4: FIX-FIRST -> S4' (a151775): **SHIP** |
| Session model (this agent) | Claude (session) | execution: closing `make check` 169 passed + ruff clean on a151775; every finding re-derived from source before fixing; per-finding probes in the suite | **SHIP** |

Writer != reviewer holds: the S2 fixes were written by the session agent; the
S3/S4 votes are grok. The S1 findings were produced by Devin + in-session
subagents (sonnet) and adjudicated by the session model against source.

## Negative claims and power

- Every fix's test was required to fail on the pre-fix code (disabled-vs-enabled);
  grok's S4 explicitly re-verified power by reverting product hunks in a scratch copy.
- "No remaining bug of class X" claims are NOT made; the checked_does_not_hold
  lists in the S3/S4 outputs are the reviewer's own non-findings.

## Skips with rationale

- gpt6pro research lane: upstream timeouts during the earlier fact round
  (recorded in task-runs/20260924-devin-build/gpt6pro-failed-run.log) — not
  re-attempted for review (its role here would duplicate finder coverage).
- Devin minors judged instrument-and-interpretation findings (B7 family
  interpretation, B10 adjacency definition) are GAP-labeled in code/docs rather
  than behaviorally fixed: implementing them requires owner-level inputs
  (paper-unstated parameters), so the honest state is a label, not a guess.
- Concurrency (58 sessions) remains UNIMPLEMENTED and is now labeled as such in
  config + REPRODUCTION.md (sequential dispatch is a documented scope limit).

## New bug classes fed back into REVIEW.md

See REVIEW.md "Always-check" items 10-11 (added this round):
- StrEnum ordering traps: never `<`-compare enum members for lifecycle order.
- Data-structure subset/double-count: queue + store population must be
  disjoint-counted in aggregate fields.
